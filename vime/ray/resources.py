"""How Ray advertises, schedules and addresses the accelerator in use.

Ray models an accelerator as a resource name plus a visible-devices variable
and resolves the second from the first, so a backend scheduled under the wrong
resource name starts with no visible device. These helpers read the name off
the accelerator rather than assuming Ray's own GPU resource; the default
remains ``GPU``, so the behavior on a GPU host is unchanged.
