"""Compact-rollout helpers for ``test_qwen2.5_0.5B_fanout_short.py``.

These helpers are imported by module path from the Ray job started by the E2E
test. They live on the test-only portion of ``PYTHONPATH`` because they are
test fixtures, not part of vime's public or internal runtime API.

``compact_generate`` fans one input sample out to N siblings sharing the same
``rollout_id``. The normal BatchBuilder handles prompt-group reward statistics
and per-rollout loss averaging; this fixture does not override either path.
